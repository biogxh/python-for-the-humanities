However, essential representational machinery is missing from the current generation of Semantic Web tools and languages. When that machinery is added, the resulting capabilities offer a combination of novelty and flexibility that may usher in a wave of commercial Semantic Web tool-based applications that precedes the true arrival of the Semantic Web. We have constructed a system, the Semantic Engineering Workbench (SEW), that is proficient at managing situated data. Achieving a practical implementation necessitated extending the basic RDF tools (Hewlett-Packard’s Jena and Stanford’s Protégé) to support contexts. In the SEW, a context references a set of statements having common spatial, temporal (and other metadata) attributes. We investigated multiple possible implementations of contexts, and found significant drawbacks in the most common approaches. The clear winners are quads (adding a fourth field of type ‘context ’ to each triple results in a quadruple, or quad), and object-oriented contexts (a context mechanism that references individuals instead of statements). Most existing Semantic Web tools (e.g., Jena and Protégé) do not understand contextualized data. For these tools, object-oriented",2016-02-01T21:55:28Z,,,,,,,,,citeseerx.ist.psu.edu,,,2016-02-01T21:55:28Z,,,,23

In particular, the ever-growing mass of specialized documentation available on-line, in industrial and governmental archives or in digital libraries, calls for advances in terminology processing for tasks such as information retrieval, cross-language querying, indexing of multimedia documents, translation aids, document routing and summarization, etc. This article presents a new domain of research and development in natural language processing (NLP) that is concerned with the representation, acquisition, and recognition of terms. It begins with presenting the basic notions about the concept of ‘terms’, ranging from the classical view, to the recent concepts. There are two main areas of research involving terminology in NLP, which are, term acquisition and term recognition. Finally, this article presents the recent advances and prospects in term acquisition and automatic indexing.",2016-01-04T07:55:24Z,,,,,,,,,www.oxfordhandbooks.com,,,2016-01-04T08:12:21Z,,,,9
